# AncientGreek Language Support for LibreOffice / OpenOffice

This is an **unofficial** backup of the full latest version of the AncientGreek plugin for LibreOffice & OpenOffice (with documentation):

Development of the plugin seems to have stagnated over the past couple of years, so creating this repository is a matter of digital preservation. If the project were to close down entirely, that would be a tragic loss for us scholars. Yet as long as the official download methods persist, those should be used instead. 

## Installation instructions
(copied from https://members.hellug.gr/sng/ancientgreekoxt/download.html#install)

AncientGreek uses Python code in order to implement some of its features. This means that both OpenOffice and LibreOffice should be installed with its "Python-UNO bridge" (the "link" between LO/AOO and Python).

Some Linux distributions, for example Debian based distributions (Ubuntu, etc) do not install Python-UNO bridge by default when installing LibreOffice. In this case you should make sure that the `libreoffice-script-provider-python` package (or equivalent) is installed before trying to install AncientGreek.

On Windows and Mac OS it seems that Python-UNO is installed by default, so there shouldn't be a problem with these Operation Systems.

After downloading AncientGreek-x.x.oxt (x.x is the version number) browse to its save location and double click on it. LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) will open and the Extension Manager will be executed.

Click "OK" to continue.

Then the licensing info will be shown to you. Click on "Scroll Down" until the button "Accept" gets enabled and click on it.

When the installation is over, you will see AncientGreek in the installed extensions list. Just click on "Close" and restart the program, so the changes take effect.

You will be able to use the AncientGreek extension as soon as the program starts again.
